This separation is crucial for achieving data independence, which is the ability to change the schema at one level without affecting the schema at the next higher level.\n\n### Logical Data Independence vs. Physical Data Independence\n\n- **Logical Data Independence** refers to the capacity to change the conceptual schema without having to change the external schemas or application programs. For example, if a new field is added to a table in the conceptual schema, the external schema does not need to change as long as the applications do not use the new field. This allows for flexibility in modifying the database structure without impacting user views or applications.\n\n- **Physical Data Independence** is the ability to change the internal schema without affecting the conceptual schema. For instance, changes in storage devices or file structures can be made to improve performance without altering the conceptual schema. This means that the way data is stored can be optimized without affecting the logical structure of the database.\n\n### Schema Mappings\n\nSchema mappings are essential for maintaining consistency across the three levels:\n- **External to Conceptual Mapping:** Ensures that user views (external schemas) are consistent with the conceptual schema. This mapping allows different users to have customized views of the same conceptual data.\n- **Conceptual to Internal Mapping:** Ensures that the conceptual schema is consistent with the internal schema. This mapping allows the physical storage of data to be optimized without affecting the logical view of the data.\n\n### Importance and Implementation in Commercial DBMSs\n\nWhile the three-schema architecture is rarely implemented explicitly in commercial DBMSs, it remains conceptually important for several reasons:\n- **Conceptual Clarity:** It provides a clear framework for understanding the separation of concerns in database design and management.\n- **Data Independence:** It highlights the importance of data independence, which is a critical feature for database systems to adapt to changing requirements without extensive rework.\n- **Educational Value:** It serves as a foundational concept in database education, helping students and professionals understand the layered architecture of database systems.\n\nCommercial DBMSs often do not implement this architecture explicitly because of the complexity and overhead involved in maintaining strict separation between the levels. However, they do incorporate the principles of data independence and schema mappings to some extent to ensure flexibility and efficiency in database management.\n\nOverall, the three-schema architecture remains a valuable conceptual tool for understanding and designing database systems, even if it is not fully realized in practice.", "citations": [{"source_index": 0, "page_number": 16, "cited_text": "Three-Schema Architecture \u25ceProposed to support DBMS characteristics of: \u25c9Program data independence. \u25c9Support of multiple views of data. \u25ceDefines DBMS schemas at three levels: \u25c9Internal schema at the internal level to describe data storage structures and access paths.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 History\nmilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,\nmaster\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuition\nwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week and", "segment_page_start": null, "segment_page_end": null, "chunk_page_start": null, "chunk_page_end": null, "text": "Document context: the following excerpt is from a document titled 'National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview'.

Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students).

Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week and", "source_index": 0, "kb_id": "database_docs", "file_name": "", "document_type": "text"}, {"doc_id": "general_club.pdf", "chunk_start": 8, "chunk_end": 18, "score": 0.5733536675128797, "content": "Document context: the following excerpt is from a document titled 'National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview'.

Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries.

(NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.)

Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 History\nmilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,\nmaster\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuition\nwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 History\nmilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,\nmaster\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuition\nwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling to\nNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 History\nmilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,\nmaster\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuition\nwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling to\nNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 History\nmilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,\nmaster\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuition\nwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling to\nNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling to\nNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 History\nmilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,\nmaster\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuition\nwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 History\nmilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,\nmaster\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuition\nwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,and International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly.

Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 Historymilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng\n(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,master\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuitionwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,\nand International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 Historymilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng\n(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities. Total area ~251 ha (620 acres). Also a campus in Meilun (Hualien City). Faculties and Academic Programs NDHU comprises eight colleges\noffering a wide range of disciplines. These include: Humanities & Social Sciences; Science & Engineering; Management; Hua-Shih College of Education; The Arts (Fine Arts/Music); Indigenous Studies;\nEnvironmental Studies and Oceanography; and Huilan College (general education). Altogether NDHU has on the order of 35\u201344 academic departments and about 48\u201356 graduate institutes (offering bachelor\u2019s,master\u2019s and PhD programs). The student body is roughly 10,000+ (about 3,800 graduate students), of whom ~900\u20131,000 (\u22488\u201310%) are international. Study fields span science & engineering (computer\nscience, physics, electrical engineering, etc.), environmental and marine sciences, business and management, education, law, liberal arts (Chinese/English literature, history, philosophy, etc.),\nindigenous languages & culture, music/arts, and design. Many programs are offered in Chinese, with some English-taught degrees in key fields (engineering, management, environmental science, etc.).Admission Requirements \u2022 Local (ROC) students: Taiwanese applicants (including Hong Kong/Macau Chinese) apply via the Ministry of Education\u2019s standard admissions (e.g. the College Entrance Examination\nand related selection processes). Admission is competitive and based on exam scores and other criteria. Only applicants meeting the national entrance exam requirements and departmental quotas are\nadmitted. \u2022 International students: Foreign applicants must hold non-Chinese (non-ROC) nationality and must not have entered Taiwan as \u201coverseas Chinese\u201d. Educational prerequisites are required: a\nsenior high-school diploma (or equivalent) for undergraduate admission, a bachelor\u2019s degree for master\u2019s programs, and a master\u2019s degree for doctoral programs. There are also special application\nchannels for overseas Chinese, Hong Kong/Macau students, and cross-strait students. International students apply online during the advertised application windows (typically two rounds in the fall\ncycle). All materials (transcripts, proof of language ability, recommendation letters, etc.) are submitted via NDHU\u2019s admissions system. (For details see the NDHU International Students AdmissionGuidelines.) Tuition Fees and Scholarships \u2022 Tuition (2024/25): Tuition at NDHU is relatively low by Western standards. For international students, the undergraduate tuition plus fees is about\nNT$48,000\u201355,580 per semester, and graduate programs about NT$21,480\u201325,800 per semester (2024 rates). (A credit fee of NT$3,060 applies for some courses.) The 2025 tuition schedule will be announced\nafter MOE approval. Domestic (ROC) students and overseas Chinese pay lower rates (undergraduate tuitions roughly NT$16,000\u201317,000 per semester plus fees). \u2022 Scholarships: NDHU offers several\nmerit-based scholarships to reduce costs: For example, the NDHU International Student Scholarship provides a 50\u2013100% tuition waiver plus a stipend (NT$20,000 per semester for bachelor\u2019s students,\nNT$30,000 per semester for master\u2019s/PhD students). The NDHU Southward Scholarship (for applicants from Southeast Asia, etc.) covers 100% of tuition (excluding dorm and fees) and adds NT$6,000/month\nstipend plus NT$8,000/month research incentive. In addition, Taiwan government scholarships (e.g. Taiwan Scholarship/MOE and MOFA programs) allow select foreign students to study at NDHU with tuitionwaivers and monthly stipends (for instance NT$15,000\u201330,000 per month, depending on degree). Many departments also offer travel grants or research awards to outstanding students. Rankings, Reputation,\nand International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei.

Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities.

(In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

Rankings, Reputation,\nand International Collaborations NDHU is considered a well-regarded public university in Taiwan\u2019s east. In recent global rankings: Times Higher Education (THE) 2025 places NDHU in the 1501+ tier\nworldwide. QS World University Rankings 2025 ranks it in the #1201\u20131400 band globally. (In Taiwan\u2019s national context, NDHU often appears among the top 10\u201315 universities.) For example, THE ranked NDHU\n10th among Taiwan\u2019s universities in 2020. NDHU also excels in certain subjects: e.g. its Computer Science program was THE-ranked #5 in Taiwan (globally 301\u2013400 band), and its Environmental and Marine\nprograms are notable. In the THE Impact Rankings 2023 (for UN Sustainable Development Goals), NDHU was ranked #10 in Taiwan, with particularly strong showings (top 100 globally) in SDG7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and SDG15 (Life on Land). NDHU has a strong international outlook: about 8\u201310% of its students are from abroad. It maintains formal partnerships and exchange programs with dozens of\nuniversities worldwide. For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line. Frequent trains connect Shoufeng to Hualien City (north) and Taitung\n(south). For example, the train from Shoufeng to Hualien Station takes about 18 minutes. Commuting from Taipei to Hualien by train takes ~4\u20135 hours. \u2022 Bus: Hualien Bus operates local routes.\nCrucially, Route 1121 runs directly from Hualien City (near TRA Hualien Station) to Shoufeng/NDHU once an hour, taking ~45\u201350 minutes. Taxis and shuttle vans are also available between Hualien and thecampus. \u2022 Highway/Car: Provincial Highway 9 passes through Shoufeng, linking it to Hualien (north) and Taitung (south). Driving from Hualien City to NDHU takes ~20\u201330 minutes by car. Taiwan\u2019s\nnorth-south highways and Highways 8/9 make Hualien reachable in about 3\u20134 hours from Taipei by road. \u2022 Air: The nearest airport is Hualien Airport (~20 km north). Domestic flights operate to Taipei\nSongshan and Taoyuan, and (seasonally) to Kaohsiung. A taxi from the airport to NDHU takes roughly 30\u201340 minutes. \u2022 Local transit: Within Hualien and Shoufeng, buses (NT$15\u201325) and scooters are\ncommon. On campus, NDHU runs shuttle buses around the valley, and students often bike or walk between facilities (the campus is bike-friendly). In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

In summary, although NDHU is outside Taiwan\u2019s major\ncities, it remains accessible by multiple modes of transport. The combination of train, bus and road makes travel to/from Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung feasible in a day. Most students traveling toNDHU first arrive at Hualien Station or Airport, then transfer to local buses/taxis for the final leg to campus.

This document is about: the overview of National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) in Taiwan, detailing its history, academic programs, admission requirements, campus life, and facilities.\n\nNational Dong Hwa University (NDHU) \u2013 Overview Founded in July 1994 (planning began in 1991), National Dong Hwa University (NDHU) is a national research university in Hualien County, Taiwan. Its\nfirst president was economist Paul Mu. NDHU started with four colleges (Humanities & Social Sciences, Science & Engineering, Management, and Indigenous Studies). Notably, it established Taiwan\u2019s first\nCollege of Indigenous Studies in 2001, dedicated to Austronesian and ethnic studies. On August 1, 2008, NDHU merged with the former National Hualien University of Education (a teachers college founded\nin 1947), thereby incorporating the urban Meilun campus. Today NDHU operates the main Shoufeng campus (251 hectares in a scenic river valley) and the Meilun campus in Hualien City. \u2022 Historymilestones: Established 1994 (approved 1991); Indigenous Studies College opened 2001; merged with National Hualien U. of Education (Meilun campus) in 2008. \u2022 Campus: Main campus in rural Shoufeng\n(Hualien County), with gardens, a lake and modern facilities.

For instance, NDHU reports academic links with 40+ institutions globally. Recent collaborations include a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Universitas Pertamina\n(Indonesia) on sustainable development research. The university is also active in regional consortia \u2013 e.g. it participates in Taiwan\u2019s European Union Centre network and hosts EU studies initiatives.These ties enable student/faculty exchanges, joint research (e.g. in renewable energy, environmental science), and dual-degree programs with partner schools. Research Focus Areas and Facilities NDHU\nis known for interdisciplinary research, especially in environmental, marine, and cultural studies. Its College of Environmental Studies & Oceanography (est. 2009) is Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated\nenvironmental science school. NDHU collaborates closely with the National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium (NMMBA) in Pingtung: in 2005 it co-founded graduate institutes in Marine Biotechnology and\nMarine Biodiversity. These leverage NMMBA\u2019s state-of-the-art labs and NDHU faculty, making marine science a specialty. The university also leads in Indigenous and cultural studies \u2013 its College ofIndigenous Studies (since 2001) focuses on Taiwanese aboriginal languages, arts and social development, serving as a research hub for Austronesian cultures. Other strengths include biotechnology,\nearth sciences, and business/tourism research (notably an ARWU-ranked top-4 program in Hospitality & Tourism). NDHU\u2019s facilities support this research: the campus has modern laboratories, an ecology\nfield station, and technical centers. The NDHU Library holds over 2 million volumes (the 8th-largest academic collection in Taiwan). Graduate students can use specialized equipment for molecular\nbiology, environmental monitoring, and renewable energy, often in collaboration with nearby research institutes. For example, NDHU researchers publish in high-impact journals on topics like\nsustainable tourism, marine conservation, and adaptive ecosystem management, reflecting their access to rich field sites (Taroko National Park, coastal zones) and academic partnerships. NDHU\u2019s\nresearch resources include well-equipped labs and modern libraries. The image above shows one of NDHU\u2019s main campus buildings (housing the library and labs), highlighting the campus\u2019s green spaces andfacilities. Campus Life, Student Activities, and Clubs NDHU offers a vibrant campus life with numerous student organizations. The Shoufeng campus combines natural scenery with a focus on\nsustainability and indigenous culture. The Student Activities Division reports 59 formal clubs and 9 informal clubs on the Shoufeng campus (plus additional clubs on the Meilun campus). These span five\ncategories: academic/special interest (e.g. language, science), service/volunteer, physical/sports, arts/cultural (music, dance, painting), and social/recreation. The university also supports a\nStudent Association and student council for campus governance. Student clubs host regular events \u2013 for example, \u201cShow Tonight\u201d talent shows, singing contests, and cultural festivals are annual\nhighlights. Clubs also engage in community service (e.g. local education outreach, environmental clean-ups). The NDHU Astronomy Club, for instance, has won national recognition. On-campus facilities\ninclude sports fields, an arts and performance center, and student lounges. A notable tradition is the integration of local indigenous culture \u2013 the university often holds Aboriginal Arts Week andcreative workshops reflecting the heritage of Hualien\u2019s native communities. Student Housing and Accommodation NDHU provides multiple on-campus dormitories for students. Rooms are typically shared (2\u20134\nstudents) and include basic furnishings and internet. Dormitory fees are very affordable \u2013 for 2024\u201325, on-campus housing costs about NT$9,500\u201316,500 per semester (depending on the dorm and room\ntype). (NDHU has over a dozen dorm buildings on Shoufeng and Meilun campuses, some reserved for internationals or graduate students.) Admissions to dorms is usually by lottery or priority (e.g.\nfirst-year students and international students often get preference). Many upperclassmen choose off-campus housing in Shoufeng Township or nearby Hualien City. Private rentals are inexpensive by\nTaiwanese standards; a simple shared apartment might cost on the order of NT$5,000\u201310,000 per month, though prices vary. Hualien City (16 km north) offers more rental options, markets, and\nconvenience. (For reference, a small studio apartment in Hualien can be as low as ~NT$6,000\u20138,000 monthly, much lower than Taipei rents.) The campus area has convenience stores, student cafeterias andshops for daily needs. NDHU\u2019s International Students Division provides a dormitory manual and assistance for finding housing. Cost of Living in Hualien Hualien is one of the more affordable cities in\nTaiwan. NDHU estimates typical personal expenses (food, transport, utilities, etc.) at NT$30,000\u201345,000 per semester for a student (roughly USD $1,000\u20131,500). Monthly living costs thus fall around\nNT$7,500\u201311,000 on average. For comparison, local prices are lower than in Taipei: a meal on campus can cost NT$60\u2013100, a cinema ticket about NT$260, and groceries are modest (see Numbeo data). \u2022\nFood: Campus cafeterias and local eateries are cheap (a bowl of noodles ~NT$50\u201380). Evening night markets and street food in Hualien City offer variety (e.g. Dongdamen night market). \u2022 Transport:\nPublic buses in Hualien cost NT$15\u201325 per ride. Many students use NT$0.5\u20131.0/day campus shuttle or rent bicycles (campus has bike lanes). Gasoline is around NT$117/gallon if using scooters. \u2022 Other:\nUtilities (electricity, water, internet) for a small apartment run on the order of NT$3,000\u20134,000/month. Mobile phone plans (~10 GB) are under NT$800/mo. Leisure (movies, gyms) is inexpensive (movie\n~NT$260; gym ~NT$1,500/mo). Overall, students report that living in Hualien is very budget-friendly. A monthly budget of NT$10,000\u201315,000 (including modest rent) is usually sufficient for acomfortable student lifestyle outside of Taipei. Transportation and Accessibility NDHU is well-connected despite its rural setting. The campus is located in Shoufeng Township, about 15\u201316 km south of\nHualien City. Transportation options include: \u2022 Train (TRA): The nearest station is Shoufeng Station on Taiwan\u2019s Eastern Line.
